fablab-reset-sign
===================

by Stefan Siegl

This is a small pet project of mine especially to practice use of some of our Fablab's tools.
In escence I'd like to build a reset sign [like in this xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/363/);
slightly different however: I'd like to have more numbers displayed like minutes, hours and
days in order to have some more going on and to glance at ...

The idea is to use six seven segment displays connected to 74HC595 shift registers and
controlled by some Atmel ATmega AVR.
